<p class="pfirst"><span>One evening an Old Gentleman was
taking a walk in the city of London,
when some one spoke to him in a soft,
sweet voice that fell pleasantly upon his ears.
He turned hastily round, and found at his
elbow a pretty little girl of some thirteen
summers, who begged to be directed to a
certain street which was in quite another
part of London.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It is a very long way from here, my
child," said the Old Gentleman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I know that, sir," she replied timidly.
"I am afraid it </span><em class="italics">is</em><span> a very long way, for I
came from there to-night."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Alone?" said the Old Gentleman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh yes; I don't mind that.  But I am
a little afraid now, for I have lost my road."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And what made you ask it of me?
Suppose I should tell you wrong?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am sure you will not do that," said
the little maiden.  "You are such a very
old gentleman, and walk so slow yourself."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As the child spoke these words a tear
came into her clear eye, and her slight figure
trembled as she looked up into the Old
Gentleman's face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come," said he, "I'll take you there."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She put her hand in his as if she had
known him from her cradle; and they
trudged away together, the little creature
rather seeming to lead and take care of the
Old Gentleman than he to be protecting her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Who has sent you so far by yourself?"
said he.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Somebody who is very kind to me, sir."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And what have you been doing?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That I must not tell," said the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Old Gentleman looked at the little
creature with surprise, for he wondered what
kind of errand it might be that made her
unwilling to answer the question.  Her
quick eye seemed to read his thoughts.  As
it met his she added that there was no harm
in what she had been doing, but it was a
great secret—a secret which she did not
even know herself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was said with perfect frankness.  She
now walked on as before, talking cheerfully
by the way; but she said no more about
her home, beyond remarking that they were
going quite a new road, and asking if it
were a short one.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At length, clapping her hands with
pleasure and running on before her new
friend for a short distance, the little girl
stopped at a door, and remaining on the
step till the Old Gentleman came up,
knocked at it when he joined her.  When
she had knocked twice or thrice there was
a noise as if some person were moving
inside, and at length a faint light was seen
through the glass of the upper part of the
door.  As this light approached very slowly
it showed clearly both what kind of person
it was who advanced and what kind of
apartment it was through which he came.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was a little old man, with long gray
hair, whose face and figure, as he held the
light above his head and looked before him,
could be plainly seen.  The place through
which he made his way was one of those
found in odd corners of the town, and
known as "curiosity shops."  There were
suits of mail standing like ghosts in armour
here and there; rusty weapons of various
kinds; twisted figures in china, and wood,
and iron, and ivory; curtains, and strange
furniture that might have been designed
in dreams.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The thin, worn face of the little old man
was suited to the place.  He might have
groped among old churches, and tombs,
and deserted houses, and gathered all the
spoils with his own hands.  As he turned
the key in the lock he looked at the Old
Gentleman with some surprise.  The door
being opened, the child addressed him as
her grandfather, and in a few words told
him the little story of her meeting with
her new friend.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, bless thee, child," said the old
man, patting her on the head, "how couldst
thou miss thy way?  What if I had lost
thee, Nell!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I would have found my way back to
you, grandfather," said the child boldly.
"Never fear."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man kissed her, then turned to
the stranger, and begged him to walk in.
He did so.  The door was closed and
locked.  Going first with the light, the
old man led the way into a small sitting-room
behind the shop.  From this apartment
another door opened into a kind of
closet, in which stood a little bed that
a fairy might have slept in, it looked so
very small and was so prettily draped.
The child took a candle and tripped into
this little room, leaving the two old men
together.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In a few moments, however, the door of
the closet opened and the child came back,
her light-brown hair hanging loose about
her neck, and her face flushed with the
haste she had made to return.  She at
once set about preparing supper.  The Old
Gentleman was surprised to see that
everything was done by the child, and that
there appeared to be no other persons in
the house.  When she left the room for
a moment he expressed his surprise, and
the old man replied that there were few
grown persons as careful and useful as she.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It always grieves me," said the visitor,
"to see children entering on the duties of
life when they are scarcely more than infants."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It will do her no harm," said the old
man, looking steadily at his guest.  "The
children of the poor know but few pleasures.
Even the cheap delights of childhood must
be bought and paid for."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But—forgive me for saying this—you
are surely not so very poor," said the Old
Gentleman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"She is not my child, sir," returned the
old man.  "Her mother was my daughter,
and she was poor.  I save nothing, not a
penny, though I live as you see; but"—he
leaned forward to whisper—"she shall be
rich one of these days and a fine lady.
Don't you think ill of me because I use
her help.  She gives it cheerfully, as you
see, and it would break her heart if she
knew that I suffered anybody else to do
for me what her own little hands can do
so well."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At this moment the child again returned,
and the old man, motioning his visitor to
come to the table, broke off and said no
more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They had scarcely begun their repast when
there was a knock at the door, and Nell,
bursting into a hearty laugh, said it was
no doubt dear old Kit come back at last.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Foolish Nell," said her grandfather,
fondling with her hair.  "She always
laughs at poor Kit."  Then he took up
a candle, and went to open the door.
When he came back Kit was at his heels.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Kit was a shock-headed, clumsy lad, with
a very wide mouth, very red cheeks, a
turned-up nose, and a very comical look
on his face.  He at once carried a large
slice of bread and meat into a corner, and
began to eat greedily.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah!" said the old man, turning to his
guest with a sigh, as if he had spoken to
him at that very moment, "you don't know
what you say when you tell me that I
don't consider her."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You must not think too much of what
I said, my friend," said the other.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," returned the old man thoughtfully,
"no.—Come hither, Nell."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The little girl hastened from her seat, and
put her arm round his neck.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do I love thee, Nell?" said he.  "Say,
do I love thee, Nell, or no?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child only answered by her caresses,
and laid her head upon his breast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why dost thou sob?" said the grandfather,
pressing her closer to him.  "Is it
because thou know'st that I love thee, and
dost not like that I should seem to doubt
it?  Well, well; then let us say I love
thee dearly."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed, indeed you do," replied the child.
"Kit knows you do."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Kit, who in eating his bread and meat
had been swallowing two-thirds of his knife
at every mouthful with the coolness of a
juggler, stopped short and bawled, "Nobody
isn't such a fool as to say he doesn't," after
which he took a huge sandwich at one bite.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"She is poor now," said the old man,
patting the child's cheek, "but, I say again,
the time is coming when she shall be rich.
It has been a long time coming, but it
must come at last.  A very long time, but
it surely must come.  It has come to other
men, who do nothing but waste time and
money.  When will it come to me?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am very happy as I am, grandfather,"
said the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Tush, tush!" returned the old man,
"thou dost not know; how shouldst thou?"  Then
he muttered again between his teeth,
"The time </span><em class="italics">must</em><span> come—I am very sure it
must.  It will be all the better for coming
late;" and then he sighed, and still holding
the child between his knees, appeared to be
insensible to everything around him.  By
this time it was very near midnight, and
the Old Gentleman rose to go, a movement
which recalled his host to himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"One moment, sir," he said.—"Now,
Kit—near midnight, boy, and you still here!
Get home, get home, and be true to your
time in the morning, for there's work to
do.  Good-night!—There, bid him
good-night, Nell, and let him be gone."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good-night, Kit," said the child, her
eyes lighting up with merriment and kindness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good-night, Miss Nell," returned the boy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And thank this gentleman," said the old
man, "but for whose care I might have lost
my little girl to-night."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, no, master," said Kit; "that won't
do, that won't."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What do you mean?" cried the old man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I'd have found her, master," said Kit;
"I'd have found her if she was above
ground.  I would, as quick as anybody,
master.  Ha, ha, ha!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Once more opening his mouth and shutting
his eyes and laughing loudly, Kit
gradually backed to the door and roared
himself out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When he had gone, and the child was
busily clearing the table, the old man said,—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I haven't seemed to thank you enough,
sir, for what you have done to-night, but
I do thank you, humbly and heartily; and
so does she, and her thanks are worth more
than mine.  I should be sorry that you
went away and thought I was unmindful
of your goodness, or careless of her; I
am not, indeed."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Old Gentleman said he was sure of
that from what he had seen.  "But," he
added, "may I ask you a question?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ay, sir," replied the old man; "what
is it?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This delicate child," said the other,
"with so much beauty and brightness—has
she nobody to care for her but you?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," he returned, looking anxiously into
the other's face, "no, and she wants no
other."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Seeing that he seemed excited and impatient,
the visitor turned to put on an outer
coat which he had thrown off on entering
the room, meaning to say no more.  He
was surprised to see the child standing by
with a cloak upon her arm, and in her
hand a hat and stick.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Those are not mine, my dear," said the
visitor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," returned the child quietly, "they
are grandfather's."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But he is not going out to-night."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh yes, he is," said the child with a
smile.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And what becomes of you, my pretty one?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Me!  I stay here, of course.  I always do."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The stranger looked towards the old man,
but he had turned away his head.  Then he
looked back to the slight, gentle figure of
the child.  Alone!  In that gloomy place
all the long, dreary night!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell, however, seemed to have no thought
for herself, but cheerfully helped her
grandfather with his cloak, and when he was
ready, took a candle to light the way to
the street door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When they reached the door, the child,
setting down the candle, turned to say good-night,
and raised her face to kiss the visitor.
Then she ran to her grandfather, who folded
her in his arms and bade God bless her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Sleep soundly, Nell," he said in a low
voice, "and angels guard thy bed!  Do not
forget thy prayers, my sweet."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, indeed," said the child; "they make
me feel so happy."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That's well; I know they do—they
should," said the old man.  "Bless thee a
hundred times!  Early in the morning I
shall be home."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You'll not ring twice," returned the
child.  "The bell wakes me, even in the
middle of a dream."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>With this they parted.  The child opened
the door (now guarded by a shutter which
the boy had put up before he left the
house), and with another farewell, held it
until the two men had passed out.  Her
grandfather paused a moment while it was
gently closed and fastened on the inside, and
then walked on at a slow pace.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the street corner he stopped.  Looking
at his guest with a troubled face, he said that
their ways were widely different, and that he
must here take his leave.  The Old Gentleman
would have spoken, but the other
hurried quickly away, and was soon lost
in the darkness.</span></p>

<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">DRIVEN FROM HOME.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The Old Gentleman lingered about the
street for two long hours; for he
could not tear himself away from the place.
Nor could he help thinking of all the harm
that might come to the child shut up alone
in the old gloomy shop; and he wondered
what it was that took the old man from his
home so late at night.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child had told him that she </span><em class="italics">always</em><span>
stayed there quite alone; so that it was
clearly the usual thing for the old man to
spend the night away from his home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At last, quite tired out with watching
and thinking, the Old Gentleman hired a
coach and drove to his own home.  A week
later, however, he paid a second visit to
the Old Curiosity Shop to learn something
more of the strange old man and his
beautiful grandchild.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He found that the old dealer had a visitor,
a young man of about twenty-one, with a
bold but handsome face and a careless,
impudent manner.  "I tell you again," the
young fellow was saying as the Old Gentleman
entered, "that I want to see Nell my
sister."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man gave an angry reply, and the
visitor soon gathered that what the young
fellow really wanted was not so much to
see Little Nell as to wring from her
grandfather some of his money, which he said was
being hoarded to no purpose.</span></p>
<div class="align-center auto-scaled figure margin" style="width: 78%" id="figure-42">
<span id="the-old-man-gave-an-angry-reply"></span><img class="align-center block" style="display: block; width: 100%" alt="The old man gave an angry reply" src="images/img-018.jpg" />
<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">The old man gave an angry reply</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>While the quarrel was at its height the
door opened, and Little Nell herself came in.
She was followed by an elderly man with
a hard, forbidding face, and so small that
he was quite a dwarf.  His black eyes were
restless, sly, and cunning; his upper lip and
chin were bristly with a coarse, hard beard;
and his face bore a smile in which there was
neither mirth nor pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For a few moments he stood listening to
the angry voices of the two men; and when
Nell's brother had flung himself out of the
house in a fierce rage, the dwarf, whose
name was Quilp, came forward, put his hand
into his breast, and took out a bag of money.
This he handed to the old man with the
words, "I brought it myself, as, being in
gold, it was too heavy for Nell to carry
in her bag.  She ought to get used to such
loads though, for she will have gold enough
when you are dead."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I hope so," said the old man, with
something like a frown.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Hope so!" echoed the dwarf.  "Neighbour,
I wish I knew in what safe place you
have placed all I have given you from time
to time.  But you keep your secret very
close."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"My secret!" said the other, with a
haggard look.  "Yes, you are right.
I—I—keep it close—very close."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man said no more, but taking
the bag in his hand, turned away with a
slow, uncertain step.  The dwarf then took
his leave, wondering as he went what the
old man did with the money he had borrowed.
After some days, however, he was
able by means best known to himself to find
out the truth of the matter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell's grandfather was a gambler.  The
money Quilp lent him was gambled away
night after night in the vain hope of winning
a fortune for his grandchild.  When the
dwarf learnt the truth, he refused to give
the old man any more money.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This made Nell's grandfather very
unhappy, and the girl, seeing his misery,
begged him to let her go and ask for the
dwarf's help once more.  He gave her leave,
and the child brought a note in reply, to the
effect that Quilp would visit the old man
shortly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One night, the third after Nell's visit to
Quilp's house, the old man, who had been
weak and ill all day, said he should not leave
home.  The child's eyes sparkled at the
news, but her joy departed when she looked
at his worn and sickly face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Two days," he said, "two whole clear
days have passed, and there is no reply.
What did he tell thee, Nell?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Just what I have told you, dear grandfather,
indeed."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"True," said the old man faintly.  "Yes.
But tell me again, Nell.  My head fails me.
What was it that he told thee?  Nothing
more than that he would see me to-morrow
or next day?  That was in the note."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Nothing more," said the child.  "Shall
I go to him again to-morrow, dear grandfather?
Very early.  I will be there and
back before breakfast."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man shook his head, and drew
her towards him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"'Twould be of no use, my dear.  But
if he deserts me, Nell, at this moment, if
he deserts me now, I am ruined; and
worse—far worse than that—have ruined thee.
If we are beggars—"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What if we are?" cried the child
boldly.  "Let us be beggars, and be happy."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Beggars—and happy!" said the old
man.  "Poor child!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Dear grandfather," cried the girl, with
flushed face and trembling voice, "I am
not a child, I think; but even if I am, oh,
hear me pray that we may beg, or work in
open roads or fields, to earn a scanty living,
rather than live as we do now."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Nelly!" said the old man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes, rather than live as we do
now," said the child.  "If you are sad, let
me know why, and be sad too; if you waste
away, and are paler and weaker every day,
let me be your nurse and try to comfort you.
If you are poor, let us be poor together;
but let me be with you, do let me be with
you.  Do not let me see such change and
not know why, or I shall break my heart
and die.  Dear grandfather, let us leave this
sad place to-morrow, and beg our way from
door to door."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man covered his face with his
hands, and hid it in the pillow of the couch
on which he lay.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Let us be beggars," said the child,
passing an arm round his neck.  "I have no
fear but we shall have enough.  I am sure
we shall.  Let us walk through country
places, and sleep in fields and under trees,
and never think of money again, or anything
that can make you sad, but rest at nights,
and have the sun and wind upon our faces
in the day, and thank God together.  Let
us never set foot in dark rooms or houses
any more, but wander up and down wherever
we like to go; and when you are tired you
shall stop and rest in the pleasantest place
that we can find, and I will go and beg for
both."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child's voice was lost in sobs as she
dropped upon the old man's neck; nor did
she weep alone.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Meanwhile Quilp had entered the room
unseen, and skipping upon a chair, placed
himself upon the back with his feet on the
seat.  Then he looked at the two with a
leer upon his face.  Turning, the old man
saw him, and asked how he came there.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Through the door," said the dwarf.
"I wish to have some words with you
alone."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell looked at her grandfather, who
nodded, and she left the room.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Have you brought me any money?"
asked the old man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," said Quilp; "and, neighbour, you
have no secret from me now.  To think
that I should have been blinded by a mere
gambler!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am no gambler," said the old man.
"I played to win a fortune for Nell.  Do
not desert me.  I only need a few pounds
to make good my losses and to win wealth
in plenty."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But the dwarf would not listen to the
old man's pleading.  He had come, he said,
to claim his own.  The shop and its
contents were his, and he meant to take them
over at once.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He was as good as his word.  Before
long he had taken up his abode in the
parlour, where he plainly meant to stay;
and the old man was in his bed raving with
fever.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell nursed her grandfather with tender
care, and after a weary time saw him come
slowly back to life again; but his mind was
now very weak, and he spent each day in
moody thought brooding over his troubles.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The dwarf was not slow to hint that he
would be glad to see the last of Nell and
her grandfather, and at length the old man
said he would move out in a couple of days.
"Very good," said Quilp; "but mind, I
can't go beyond that time."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the dwarf had left them to themselves
the old man's tears fell fast, and
making as though he would fall upon his
knees, he begged his tender little nurse to
forgive him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Forgive you—what?" said Nell.  "O
grandfather, what should I forgive?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"All that is past, all that has come upon
thee, Nell; all that was done in that uneasy
dream," returned the old man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do not talk so," said the child.  "Pray
do not.  Let us speak of something else."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes, we will," he said.  "And it
shall be of what we talked of long ago—many
months—months is it, or weeks, or
days?  Which is it, Nell?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I do not understand you," said the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It has come back upon me to-day; it
has all come back since we have been sitting
here.  I bless thee for it, Nell."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"For what, dear grandfather?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"For what you said when we were first
made beggars, Nell.  Let us speak softly.
Hush! for if they knew downstairs they
would say that I was mad, and take thee
away from me.  We will not stop here
another day.  We will go far away from
here."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, let us go," said the child.  "Let
us be gone from this place, and never turn
back or think of it again.  Let us wander
barefoot through the world rather than
linger here."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We will," answered the old man.  "We
will travel afoot through the woods and
fields, and by the side of rivers, and trust
ourselves to God in the places where He
dwells.  It is far better to lie down at night
beneath an open sky like that yonder—see
how bright it is!—than to rest in close
rooms, which are always full of care and
weary dreams.  Thou and I together, Nell,
may be cheerful and happy yet, and learn
to forget this time as if it had never
been."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We will be happy!" cried the child,
"We never can be here."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, we never can again—never again—that's
truly said," replied the old man.  "Let
us steal away to-morrow morning, early and
softly, that we may not be seen or heard,
and leave no trace or track for them to
follow by.  Poor Nell!  Thy cheek is pale,
and thy eyes are heavy with watching and
weeping for me—I know—for me; but
thou wilt be well again, and merry too,
when we are far away.  To-morrow morning,
dear, we'll turn our faces from this scene
of sorrow, and be as free and happy as the
birds."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>And then the old man clasped his hands
above her head and said, in a few broken
words, that from that time forth they would
wander up and down together, and never
part again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child's heart beat high with hope
and joy.  She had no thought of hunger,
or cold, or thirst.  They would be happy
together as they had been before.  This was
all she cared for.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While the old man slept soundly in his
bed, she set herself to prepare for their flight.
There were a few articles of clothing for
herself to carry, as well as a few for him;
and a staff to support his feeble steps was
put ready for his use.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she had finished the old man was
yet asleep, and as she was unwilling to
disturb him, she left him to slumber on until
the sun rose.  He was then very anxious
that they should leave the house without
a minute's loss of time, and was soon
ready.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child took him by the hand, and they
trod lightly down the stairs, trembling
whenever a board creaked, and often stopping to
listen.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At last they reached the passage on the
ground floor, where the snoring of Quilp
sounded more terrible in their ears than the
roaring of lions.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They opened the door without noise, and
passing into the street, stood still.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Which way?" said the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man looked first at her, then to
the right and left, then at her again, and
shook his head.  It was plain that she was
now his guide.  The child knew it, and
putting her hand in his, led him gently
away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was the beginning of a day in June,
the deep blue sky unbroken by a cloud, and
full of brilliant light.  The streets were, as
yet, almost empty.  The houses and shops
were closed, and the sweet air of morning
fell like breath from angels on the sleeping
town.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Forth from the city, while it yet slept,
went the two poor wanderers, they knew
not whither.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">
</div>
<p class="center pfirst" id="in-the-open-country"><span class="bold large">Chapter III.</span></p>
<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">IN THE OPEN COUNTRY.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The two pilgrims, often pressing each
other's hands, or looking at each other
with a smile, went on their way in silence.
After walking a long, long way they left the
city behind, and came in sight of fields, tiny
cottages, and large mansions with lawns and
porters' lodges.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then came a turnpike, then fields again
with trees and haystacks, then a hill; and on
top of that the traveller might stop, and
looking back at old St. Paul's looming through
the smoke, might feel at last that he was clear
of London.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Near such a spot as this, and in a pleasant
field, the old man and his little guide sat down
to rest.  Nell had brought in her basket some
slices of bread and meat, and here they made
their simple breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The freshness of the day, the singing of
the birds, the beauty of the waving grass,
the deep-green leaves, the wild flowers, and
the scents and sounds that floated in the air,
filled them with gladness.  The child had
said her simple prayers once that morning,
but now in her deep thankfulness they rose
to her lips again.  The old man took off
his hat; he had no memory for the words,
but he said </span><em class="italics">Amen</em><span>, for he knew that they
were very good.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There had been an old copy of the "Pilgrim's
Progress," with pictures, upon a shelf
at home, over which Nell had often pored in
wonder.  As she looked back upon the place
they had left, one part of it came strongly
into her mind.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Dear grandfather," she said, "I feel as if
we were both pilgrims like Christian, and
had laid down on this grass all the cares
and troubles we brought with us, never to
take them up again."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, never to return, never to return,"
replied the old man, waving his hands
towards the city.  "Thou and I are free of
it now, Nell.  They shall never lure us
back."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Are you tired?" said the child.  "Are
you sure you don't feel ill from this long
walk?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I shall never feel ill again, now that we
are once away," was his reply.  "Let us be
stirring, Nell.  We must be farther away—a
long, long way farther.  We are too near
to stop and be at rest.  Come."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was a pool of clear water in the
field, in which the child now laved her
hands and face, and cooled her feet.  She
would have the old man refresh himself in
this way too; and making him sit down
upon the grass, cast the water on him with
her hands, and dried it with her dress.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I can do nothing for myself, my darling,"
said the old man.  "I don't know how it is;
I could once, but the time's gone.  Don't
leave me, Nell; say that thou'lt not leave me.
I loved thee all the while, indeed I did.  If
I lose thee too, my dear, I must die!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He laid his head upon her shoulder, and
Nell soothed him with gentle and tender
words, and smiled at his thinking they could
ever part.  He was soon calmed, and fell
asleep, singing to himself in a low voice like
a little child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He awoke refreshed, and they went on
their way once more.  The road was pleasant,
lying between beautiful pastures and
fields of corn, above which the lark trilled
out its happy song.  The air came laden
with the fragrance it caught upon its way,
and the bees hummed forth their drowsy
song as they floated by.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They were now in the open country; the
houses were very few, and often miles apart.
Now and again they came upon a cluster of
poor cottages, some with a chair or low
board put across the open door, to keep the
children from the road, others shut up close
while all the family were working in the
fields.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They walked all day, and slept at night at
a small cottage where beds were let to
travellers.  Next morning they were afoot again,
and though at first they were very tired,
recovered before long and went briskly forward.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They often stopped to rest, but only for a
short space at a time, and then went on,
having had but little food since the morning.
It was nearly five o'clock in the afternoon
when, drawing near another cluster of huts,
the child looked into each, doubtful at which
to ask for leave to rest awhile and buy a
drink of milk.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was not easy to choose, for she was
very timid.  Here was a crying child, and
there a noisy wife.  In this, the people
seemed too poor, in that too many.  At
length she stopped at one where the family
were seated round the table.  She chose
this cottage because there was an old man
sitting in a chair beside the hearth, and
she thought he was a grandfather, and would
be kind to hers.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There were, besides, the cottager, his wife,
and three little children, brown as berries.
As soon as Nell had made known her wants
she was invited within.  The eldest boy ran
out to fetch some milk, the second dragged
two stools towards the door, while the youngest
crept to his mother's gown, and looked
at the strangers from beneath his sunburnt
hand.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are welcome, master," said the old
cottager, in a thin, piping voice.  "Are you
travelling far?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sir; a long way," replied the child,
for her grandfather had turned to her for an
answer.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"From London?" asked the old man</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child said yes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The milk arrived, and Nell having opened
her little basket and selected the best pieces
for her grandfather, they made a hearty meal.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How far is it to a town or village?" she
asked of the husband.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A matter of a good five mile, my dear."
was the reply; "but you're not going on
to-night?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes, Nell," said the old man hastily.
"Farther on, farther on, darling; farther
away, if we walk till midnight."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There's a good barn hard by, master,"
said the man.  "Excuse me, but you do
seem a little tired, and unless you wish to
get on—"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes, we do," said the old man
fretfully.—"Farther away, dear Nell; pray,
farther away."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We must go on, indeed," said the child.
"We thank you very much, but we cannot
stop so soon.—I'm quite ready, grandfather."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But the woman had seen that one of Nell's
little feet was blistered and sore, and she
would not let her go until she had washed
the place, which she did so carefully and
with such a gentle hand that the child's
heart was too full for her to say more than
a fervent "God bless you!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When they had left the cottage some
distance behind Nell turned her head and saw
that the whole family, even the old
grandfather, were standing in the road, watching
them as they went on their way; and so,
with many waves of the hand and cheering
nods, and on one side at least not without
tears, they parted company.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They now walked more slowly and painfully
than they had done yet for about a mile,
when they heard the sound of wheels behind
them, and looking round saw an empty cart
drawing near to them.  The driver on
coming up to them stopped his horse and
looked hard at Nell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Didn't you stop to rest at a cottage
yonder?" he said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sir," replied the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! they asked me to look out for
you," said the man.  "I'm going your way.
Give me your hand; jump up, master."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was a great relief, for they were so
very tired that they could scarcely crawl
along.  To them the jolting cart was a
comfortable carriage, and the ride the finest in
the world.  Nell had scarcely settled herself
on a little heap of straw in one corner, when
she fell fast asleep.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She was awakened by the stopping of the
cart, which was about to turn up a by-lane.
The driver kindly got down to help her
out.  Then he pointed to some trees at a
very short distance before them, said that the
town lay in that direction, and that they had
better take the path through the churchyard.
So towards this spot they bent their weary
steps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As they crossed the churchyard they saw
two men seated upon the grass, and so busily
at work that at first they did not notice the
little girl and the old man.  Nell saw at a
glance that they were Punch and Judy men,
for she noticed Punch himself, smiling as
usual, perched upon a tombstone.  Here
and there on the ground were other parts of
the show, and the two men were mending
the wooden frame with glue and tacks.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As Nell and her grandfather drew near
they looked up.  One was a little merry
man with a bright eye and a red nose.  The
other seemed to be of a graver character.
Both greeted the newcomers heartily, and
after a few moments Nell's grandfather,
pointing to Punch and Judy, asked, "Are
you going to show them to-night?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes," said the merry man.  "Look
here," he went on, turning to his partner,
"here's Judy's clothes falling to pieces
again.  Much good </span><em class="italics">you</em><span> do at sewing
things."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell saw at once that help such as she
could give was badly needed, and said
timidly, "I have a needle, sir, in my basket,
and thread too.  Let me try to mend the
clothes for you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The showman was much pleased, and in
a few moments Nell had done the work very
neatly, to his great delight.  When she had
finished he asked whether she and the old
man were going on again.  "No farther
to-night," said Nell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If you want a place to stop at," said the
showman, "come with us to the tavern.
It's very cheap."  This they did, and in the
evening saw the Punch and Judy show in
the tavern kitchen; but Nell was so tired
that she fell asleep before the play was half
over.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Next day the showman asked the two
travellers to go with them to some races that
were being held not far away; and the old
man, who had been as pleased as a child
with the performance, at once said that they
would be much pleased to go.  So they set
off together, and for the next few days
travelled in company.</span></p>
<div class="align-center auto-scaled figure margin" style="width: 82%" id="figure-43">

<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">So they set off together</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>But after a while Nell noticed that the
two men were often whispering together,
and that they took great care to keep them
always in sight.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Grandfather," she whispered, when they
were alone for a moment, "these men think
that we have secretly left our friends, and
mean to have us sent back."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man was very much frightened,
and began to shake.  After soothing him she
said, "I shall find a time when we can steal
away.  When I do, mind you come with
me, and do not stop or speak a word."  So
at the close of a long day, when the men
were setting up the show in a suitable spot,
Nell touched the old man's arm, and turning
with him fled along the nearest road.  They
never once stopped to look behind, and
creeping under the brow of a bill at a quick
pace, made for the open fields.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">
</div>
<p class="center pfirst" id="the-village-school"><span class="bold large">Chapter IV.</span></p>
<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">THE VILLAGE SCHOOL.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It was not until they were quite tired out
and could no longer keep up the pace at
which they had fled from the race-ground
that the old man and the child stopped to
rest upon the borders of a little wood.
Here, though the race-ground could not be
seen, they could yet hear the noise of the
distant shouts, the hum of the voices, and
the beating of the drums.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Some time passed before Nell could bring
the trembling old man to a state of quiet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We are quite safe now, and have nothing
to fear indeed, dear grandfather," she said.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After a while they rose up from the
ground, and took the shady track which led
them through the wood.  Passing along it
for a short distance they came to a lane,
completely shaded by the trees on either
hand which met together overhead.  A
broken finger-post told them that this lane
led to a village three miles off, and thither
they bent their steps.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was a very small place.  The men and
boys were playing at cricket on the green;
and as the other folks were looking on, they
wandered up and down, uncertain where to
seek a humble lodging.  There was but one
old man in the little garden before his
cottage, and him they were too timid to
approach, for he was the schoolmaster, and
had "School" written up over his window
in black letters on a white board.  He was
a pale, simple-looking man, and sat smoking
his pipe in the little porch before his
cottage door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Speak to him, dear," the old man whispered.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am almost afraid to disturb him," said
the child timidly.  "He does not seem to
see us.  Perhaps if we wait a little he may
look this way."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The slight noise they made in raising the
latch caught his ear.  He looked at them
kindly, but gently shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell dropped a curtsy, and told him they
were poor travellers, who sought a shelter
for the night, for which they would gladly
pay.  The schoolmaster looked at her as she
spoke, laid aside his pipe, and rose to his
feet.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If you could direct us anywhere, sir,"
said the child, "we should take it very
kindly."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You have been walking a long way,"
said the schoolmaster.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A long way, sir," the child replied.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You're a young traveller, my child," he
said, laying his hand gently on her
head.—"Your grandchild, friend?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ay, sir," cried the old man, "and the
stay and comfort of my life."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come in," said the schoolmaster.
Then he led them into his little school-room,
which was parlour and kitchen also,
and told them that they were welcome to
stay under his roof till morning.  Before
they had done thanking him, he spread a
coarse white cloth upon the table, with
knives and plates, and bringing out some
bread and cold meat besought them to eat.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child looked round the room as she
took her seat.  There were a couple of
forms, notched and cut and inked all over;
a small deal desk perched on four legs, at
which no doubt the master sat; a few
dog's-eared books upon a high shelf; and beside
them a collection of peg-tops, balls, kites,
fishing-lines, marbles, half-eaten apples, and
other things taken from idle urchins.
Hanging on hooks upon the wall were the
cane and ruler; and near them, on a small
shelf of its own, the dunce's cap, made of
old newspapers.  But the great ornaments
of the wall were certain sentences fairly
copied in good round text, and well-worked
sums in simple addition and multiplication,
which were pasted all round the room.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes," said the old schoolmaster, following
Nell's eyes with his own; "that's beautiful
writing, my dear."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Very, sir," replied the child modestly;
"is it yours?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Mine!" he returned, taking out his
spectacles and putting them on; "I couldn't
write like that nowadays.  No, they're all
done by one hand; a little hand it is, not so
old as yours, but a very clever one."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As the schoolmaster said this he saw that
a small blot of ink had been thrown on one
of the copies; so he took a penknife from
his pocket, and going up to the wall
carefully scraped it out.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A little hand, indeed," said the poor
schoolmaster.  "Far beyond all his mates in
his learning and his sports too, how did he ever
come to be so fond of me?  That I should
love him is no wonder, but that he should
love me!"  And here the schoolmaster
stopped, and took off his spectacles to wipe
them, as though they had grown dim.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I hope there is nothing the matter, sir,"
said Nell anxiously.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not much, my dear," said the schoolmaster.
"I hoped to have seen him on
the green to-night.  But he'll be there to-morrow."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then after a pause he turned to her, and
speaking very gently, hoped she would say
a prayer that night for a sick child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After a sound night's rest the child rose
early in the morning and went down to the
room where she had supped last night.  As
the schoolmaster had already left his bed
and gone out, she began herself to make the
room neat and tidy, and had just finished
when her kind host returned.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He thanked her many times, and said
that the old dame who did such work for
him had gone out to nurse the little scholar
of whom he had told her.  The child asked
how he was, and hoped he was better.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," said the schoolmaster, shaking his
head sorrowfully.  "No better.  They even
say he is worse."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am very sorry for that, sir," said the
child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She then asked his leave to prepare
breakfast; and her grandfather coming downstairs
after a while, they all three sat down
together.  While they were eating, their
host said that the old man seemed much
tired, and stood in need of rest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If the journey you have before you is
a long one," he said, "you are very welcome
to pass another night here.  I should really
be glad if you would, friend."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He saw that the old man looked at Nell,
and added,—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I shall be glad to have your young
companion with me for one day.  If you can
do a charity to a lone man, and rest
yourself at the same time, do so.  But if you
must go again upon your journey, I wish
you well through it, and will walk a little
way with you before school begins."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What are we to do, Nell?" said the
old man in great doubt.  "Say what we're
to do, dear."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell was only too glad to stay.  She was
happy to show how thankful she was to the
kind schoolmaster by doing such household
duties as his little cottage stood in need of.
When these were done she took some
needlework from her basket and sat down upon
a stool beside the window.  Her grandfather
was resting in the sun outside, and
idly watching the clouds as they floated on
before the light summer wind.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As the schoolmaster took his seat behind
his desk to begin the day's work, the child
was afraid that she might be in the way,
and offered to go to her little bedroom.
But this he would not allow; and as he
seemed pleased to have her there, she stayed,
busying herself with her work.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Have you many scholars, sir?" she asked.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The poor schoolmaster shook his head, and
said that they barely filled the two forms.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Are the others clever, sir?" asked the
child, glancing at the wall.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good boys," returned the schoolmaster.
"good boys enough, my dear; but they'll
never do like that."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>At the top of the first form—the post of
honour in the school—was the empty place
of the little sick scholar, and at the head
of the row of pegs on which hats or caps
were hung, one was empty.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Soon began the hum of learning lessons,
the whispered jest, and all the noise and
drawl of school; and in the midst of the
din sat the poor schoolmaster, trying in vain
to fix his mind upon the duties of the day,
and to forget his little friend.  But the
work only reminded him more strongly of
the willing scholar.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I think, boys," said the schoolmaster,
when the clock struck twelve, "that I shall
give a half-holiday this afternoon."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Upon this the boys, led on by the tallest
among them, raised a great shout.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You must promise me first," said the
schoolmaster, "that you'll not be noisy, or
at least, if you are, that you'll go away and
be so—away out of the village, I mean.
I'm sure you wouldn't disturb your old
playmate."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, sir! no, sir!" said the boys in a
chorus.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Then pray don't forget—there's my dear
scholars," said the schoolmaster—"what I
have asked you, and do it as a favour to
me.  Good-bye all."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Thank'ee, sir," and "Good-bye, sir,"
were said a great many times, and the boys
went out very slowly and softly.  But there
was the sun shining, and there were the birds
singing, as the sun only shines and the birds
only sing on holidays and half-holidays;
there were the trees waving for all free
boys to climb and nestle among their leafy
branches; the hay begging them to come
and scatter it to the pure air; the smooth
ground, inviting to runs and leaps and
long walks.  It was more than boy could
bear, and with a joyous whoop the whole
band took to their heels and spread themselves
about, shouting and laughing as they
went.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It's natural, thank Heaven!" said the
poor schoolmaster, looking after them.  "I'm
very glad they didn't mind me."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Towards night an old woman came up
the garden, and meeting the schoolmaster
at the door, said he was to go to Dame
West's directly.  He and Nell were at the
moment on the point of going out for a
walk, and they hurried away together at
once.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They stopped at a cottage door, and the
schoolmaster knocked softly at it with his
hand.  It was opened without loss of time,
and they entered a room where a little group
of women were gathered about one older
than the rest, who was crying and rocking
herself to and fro.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"O dame!" said the schoolmaster, drawing
near her chair, "is it so bad as this?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"He's going fast," cried the old woman;
"my grandson's dying."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Without saying a word in reply the
schoolmaster went into another room, where
he found his little scholar, and stayed with
him till he passed gently away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Almost broken-hearted, Nell returned with
her kind friend to his cottage.  She stole
away to bed as quickly as she could, and
when she was alone gave free vent to her
sorrow in a flood of tears.  But she felt
through her grief a feeling of thankfulness
that she herself was spared to the one
relative and friend she loved so well.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The sun darting his cheerful rays into
she room awoke her next morning; and
now they must take leave of the poor
schoolmaster, and wander forth once more.  By
the time they were ready to go school had
begun.  But the schoolmaster rose from his
desk and walked with them to the gate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was with a trembling hand that the
child held out to him the money which a lady
had given her at the race-meeting for some
wild flowers, faltering in her thanks as she
thought how small the sum was, and blushing
as she offered it.  But he bade her put
it up again, and, stooping, kissed her cheek.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They bade him good-bye very many
times, and turned away, walking slowly and
often looking back, until they could see
him no more.  At length they left the
village far behind, and even lost sight of the
smoke above the trees.  They walked onward
now at a quicker pace, keeping to the
main road, meaning to go wherever it might
lead them.</span></p>

<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">THE CARAVAN.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>The afternoon had worn away into a
beautiful evening when the travellers
came to a point where the road made a
sharp turn and struck across a common.
On the border of this common, and close
to the hedge which divided it from the
fields, a caravan was drawn up to rest, upon
which they came so suddenly that they
could not have passed it by even if they
had wished to do so.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was not a shabby, dingy, dusty cart,
but a smart little house upon wheels, with
white curtains to the windows, and window
shutters of green with bright panels of red.
Neither was it a poor caravan drawn by a
single donkey or horse, for a pair of fine
horses were grazing on the grass.  Near it
at the open door (graced with a bright
brass knocker) sat a stout lady taking tea.
The tea-things, as well as a cold knuckle
of ham, were set forth upon a drum covered
with a white napkin.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It happened that at that moment the
lady of the caravan had her large cup to
her lips, and having her eyes also lifted to
the sky in her enjoyment of the tea, she
did not see the travellers when they first
came up.  It was not until she was setting
down the cup, and drawing a long breath
of contentment, that she beheld an old man
and a young child walking slowly by, and
glancing at her with hungry eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Hey!" cried the lady, scooping the
crumbs out of her lap, and swallowing the
same before wiping her lips.  "Yes, to be
sure.  Who won the second day's race,
child?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Won what, ma'am?" asked Nell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The race that was run on the second day."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I don't know, ma'am."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Don't know!" said the lady of the
caravan; "why, you were there.  I saw
you with my own eyes."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell was not a little alarmed to hear
this, supposing that the lady might be a
friend of the Punch and Judy men, but
what followed calmed her fears.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And very sorry I was," said the lady
of the caravan, "to see you in company
with a Punch—a low wretch, that people
should scorn to look at."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I was not there by choice," returned
the child; "we didn't know our way, and
the two men were very kind to us, and let
us travel with them.  Do you—do you
know them, ma'am?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Know them, child!" cried the lady of
the caravan in a sort of shriek.  "Know
them!  But you're young and know very
little, and that's your excuse for asking such
a question.  Do I look as if I knowed 'em?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, ma'am, no," said the child.  "I
beg your pardon."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was granted at once, though the lady
still appeared much ruffled by the question.
The child then said that they had left the
races on the first day, and were travelling
to the next town on that road, where they
meant to spend the night.  As the face of
the stout lady began to brighten, she asked
how far it was.  The reply was that the
town was eight miles off.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child could scarcely keep back a tear
as she glanced along the darkening road.
Her grandfather made no complaint, but
he sighed heavily, and peered forward into
the dusky distance.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The lady of the caravan was about to
gather her tea-things together, but noting
the child's look, she stopped.  Nell curtsied,
thanked her, and giving her hand to the
old man, had already got some fifty yards
or so away, when the lady of the caravan
called to her to return.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come nearer, nearer still," said she.
"Are you hungry, child?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not very; but we are tired, and it's—it
</span><em class="italics">is</em><span> a long way—"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, hungry or not, you had better
have some tea," said the lady.—"I suppose
you are agreeable to that, old gentleman?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The grandfather humbly pulled off his
hat, and thanked her.  The lady of the
caravan then bade him come up the steps
also; but the drum proving an unsuitable
table for two, they came down again, and
sat upon the grass.  The lady then handed
down to them the tea-tray, the bread-and-butter,
and the ham.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Set 'em out near the hind wheels, child—that's
the best place," said their friend
from above.  "Now, hand up the teapot
for a little more hot water and a pinch of
fresh tea, and then both of you eat and
drink as much as you can, and don't spare
anything; that's all I ask of you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While they were eating, the lady of the
caravan came down the steps, and with her
hands clasped behind her, walked up and
down in a very stately manner.  She looked
at the caravan from time to time with
an air of calm delight, and seemed to be
much pleased with the red panels and the
brass knocker.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she had taken this exercise for some
time, she sat down upon the steps and called
"George," whereupon a man in a carter's
frock, who had been hidden in a hedge up
to this time, parted the twigs and looked out.
He was seated on the ground, and had on
his legs a baking-dish and a stone bottle, in
his right hand a knife, and in his left a fork.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, missus," said George.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How did you find the cold pie, George?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It warn't amiss, mum."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We are not a heavy load, George?</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That's always what the ladies say,"
replied the man.  "If you see a woman
a-driving, you'll always see she never will
keep her whip still; the horse can't go fast
enough for her.  If horses have got their
proper load, a woman always thinks that
they can bear something more.  What is
the cause of this here?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Would these two travellers make much
difference to the horses if we took them
with us?" asked his mistress, pointing to
Nell and the old man, who were now ready
to go on their way on foot.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"They'd make a difference, in course,"
said George slowly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Would they make </span><em class="italics">much</em><span> difference?"
repeated his mistress.  "They can't be
very heavy."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The weight o' the pair, mum," said
George, eyeing them carefully, "would be
a trifle under that of Oliver Cromwell."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell was very much surprised that the
man should know the weight of one whom
she had read of in books as having lived
long before their time; but she soon forgot
the subject in the joy of hearing that
they were to go forward in the caravan,
for which she thanked its lady earnestly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She now helped to put away the tea-things,
and the horses being by that time
harnessed, mounted into the van, followed
by her delighted grandfather.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Their kind friend then shut the door,
and sat herself down by her drum at an
open window; and the steps being put
up by George, and stowed under the
carriage, away they went, with a great
noise of flapping, and creaking, and straining,
the bright brass knocker, which nobody
ever knocked at, knocking every moment
a double knock of its own accord, as they
jolted heavily along.</span></p>

<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">THE WAX-WORK SHOW.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>When they had travelled slowly forward
for some short distance, Nell
looked timidly round the caravan.  One half
of it was carpeted, and so cut off at the
farther end as to form a sleeping-place, which
was shaded, like the little windows, with fair
white curtains, though it was very small.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The other half served for a kitchen, and
was fitted up with a stove, whose small
chimney passed through the roof.  It also
held a larder, several chests, a great pitcher
of water, a few cooking utensils and pieces
of crockery.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The lady of the caravan sat at one window
and little Nell and her grandfather sat at
the other, while the machine jogged slowly
onward.  At first the two travellers spoke
little, and only in whispers; but as they
grew more used to the place they began
to talk about the country through which
they were passing, until the old man fell
asleep.  The lady of the caravan then asked
Nell to come and sit beside her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, child," she said, "how do you
like this way of travelling?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell replied that she thought it was very
pleasant indeed.  The lady of the caravan
sat looking at the child for a long time
in silence.  Then, getting up, she brought
out from a corner a large roll of canvas,
about a yard in width, which she laid upon
the floor, and spread open with her foot
until it nearly reached from one end of
the caravan to the other.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There, child," she said, "read that."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell walked down it, and read aloud,
in huge black letters, the words "JARLEY'S
WAX-WORK."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Read it again," said the lady.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Jarley's Wax-work," repeated Nell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That's me," said the lady.  "I am Mrs. Jarley."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Giving the child a pleasant look, the lady
of the caravan unfolded another scroll, on
which were the words "One hundred figures
the full size of life;" and then another,
on which was written, "The only real
wax-work in the world."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she had shown these to the
astonished child, she brought forth several
handbills used to announce the show, one
of which ran:—</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="line-block outermost">
<div class="line"><span>"If I knowed a donkey wot wouldn't go</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>To see Mrs. Jarley's wax-work show,</span></div>
<div class="line"><span>Do you think I'd acknowledge him?</span></div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line"><span>Oh; no, no!</span></div>
<div class="inner line-block">
<div class="line"><span>Then run to Jarley's."</span></div>
<div class="line"> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="pfirst"><span>When she had shown all these treasures
to her young companion, Mrs. Jarley rolled
them up, and having put them carefully
away, sat down again, and looked at the
child in triumph.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Never go into the company of a Punch
any more," said Mrs. Jarley, "after this."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I never saw any wax-work, ma'am," said
Nell.  "Is it funnier than Punch?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Funnier!" said Mrs. Jarley in a shrill
voice.  "It is not funny at all."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh!" said Nell very humbly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It isn't funny at all," repeated Mrs. Jarley.
"It's calm and—classical.  No low
beatings and knockings about, no jokings
and squeakings, like your precious Punches,
but always the same, and so like life that
if wax-work only spoke and walked about,
you'd hardly know the difference.  I won't
go so far as to say that, as it is, I've seen
wax-work quite like life, but I've certainly
seen some life that was exactly like wax-work."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Is it here, ma'am?" asked Nell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Is what here, child?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The wax-work, ma'am."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, bless you, child, what are you
thinking of?  How could it be here, where
you see everything except the inside of one
little cupboard and a few boxes?  It's gone
on in the other vans to the next town, and
there it'll be shown the day after to-morrow.
You are going to the same town, and you'll
see it, I dare say.  I suppose you couldn't
stop away if you was to try ever so much."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I shall not be in the town, I think,
ma'am," said the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not there!" cried Mrs. Jarley.  "Then
where will you be?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I—I—don't quite know.  I am not certain."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You don't mean to say that you don't
know where you're going to!" said the lady
of the caravan.  "What line are you in?
You looked to me at the races, child, as if
you were quite out of your place."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We were there quite by accident,"
returned Nell; "we are poor people, ma'am,
and are only wandering about.  We have
nothing to do; I wish we had."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You amaze me more and more," said
Mrs. Jarley after a while.  "Why, what do
you call yourselves?  Not beggars?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed, ma'am, I don't know what else
we are," returned the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Lord bless me!" said the lady of the
caravan.  "I never heard of such a thing.
Who'd have thought it?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She remained so long silent after this that
Nell feared she was vexed.  At length she
said,—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And yet you can read.  And write too,
I shouldn't wonder?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, ma'am," said the child timidly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, and what a thing </span><em class="italics">that</em><span> is!"
returned Mrs. Jarley.  "</span><em class="italics">I</em><span> can't."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell said, "Indeed!" in a tone of surprise
and doubt.  Mrs. Jarley said no more, and
after a while Nell withdrew to the other
window and sat down near her grandfather,
who was now awake.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After a while the lady of the caravan roused
herself, and calling the driver to come under
the window at which she was seated, spoke
to him in a low tone of voice, as if she were
asking his advice.  This talk at length ended,
she drew in her head again, and bade Nell
come near.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And the old gentleman too," said
Mrs. Jarley; "for I want to have a word with
him.—Do you want a good place for your
grandchild, master?  If you do, I can put
her in a way of getting one.  What do you
say?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I can't leave her," answered the old
man.  "What would become of me without her?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I should have thought you were old
enough to take care of yourself, if ever you
will be," said Mrs. Jarley sharply.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But he never will be," said the child, in
an earnest whisper.  "I fear he never will
be again.  Pray do not speak harshly to him.
We are very thankful to you," she added
aloud; "but neither of us could part from
the other if all the wealth of the world were
halved between us."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Jarley was a little taken aback at this,
and looked somewhat crossly at the old man,
who took Nell's hand and kept it in his own.
After a pause, she thrust her head out of
the window again, and spoke once more to
the driver.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then she said to the old man, "If you
work for yourself, there would be
plenty for you to do in the way of helping
to dust the figures, taking the checks, and so
forth.  What I want your grandchild for,
is to point 'em out to the company.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That would soon be learnt," the lady
went on, "and she has a way with her that
people would like, though she does come
after me; for I've always been used to go
round with visitors myself, which I should
keep on doing now, only that I do need a
little ease."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then Mrs. Jarley said that as for salary
she could not pledge herself until she had
tested Nell's fitness for the work.  But board
and lodging, both for her and her grandfather,
she </span><em class="italics">would</em><span> give; and she also passed her word
that the food should be always good and
plentiful.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell and her grandfather talked it over;
and while they were doing so Mrs. Jarley,
with her hands behind her, walked up and
down the caravan, as she had walked after
tea on the green, with great dignity.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Now, child?" cried Mrs. Jarley, coming
to a halt, as Nell turned towards her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We are very much obliged to you,
ma'am," said Nell, "and will do as you
wish."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And you'll never be sorry for it,"
returned Mrs. Jarley.  "I am pretty sure of
that.  So as that's all settled, let us have
a bit of supper."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the meantime the caravan rolled on,
and came at last upon the paved streets of a
town, which were very quiet; for it was
by this time near midnight, and the people
were all abed.  As it was too late to go to
the exhibition room, they turned aside into a
piece of waste ground that lay just within
the old town gate, and drew up there for the
night, near to another caravan in which part
of the famous wax-work show had travelled.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This caravan, being now empty, was given
to the old man as his sleeping-place; and
within its wooden walls Nell made him up
the best bed she could.  For herself, she was
to sleep in Mrs. Jarley's own van as a special
mark of that lady's favour.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 4em">
</div>
<p class="center pfirst" id="nell-the-bread-winner"><span class="bold large">Chapter VIII.</span></p>
<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">NELL THE BREAD-WINNER.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Nell slept so long that when she awoke,
Mrs. Jarley, wearing her large bonnet,
was already preparing breakfast.  She heard
Nell's excuses for being late with great
good-humour, and said that she should not
have roused her if she had slept on until
noon.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Because it does you good," said the lady
of the caravan, "when you're tired, to sleep
as long as ever you can; and that's another
blessing of your time of life—you can sleep
so very sound; </span><em class="italics">I</em><span> can't, I'm sorry to say."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Shortly afterwards the child sat down
with her grandfather and Mrs. Jarley to
breakfast.  The meal finished, Nell helped
to wash the cups and saucers, and put them
in their proper places; and these duties
done, Mrs. Jarley dressed herself in a very
bright shawl for the purpose of passing
through the streets of the town.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The van will come on to bring the
boxes," said Mrs. Jarley, "and you had
better come in it, child.  I must walk, very
much against my will; but the people
expect it of me.  How do I look, child?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell at once said that she looked very
nice, and Mrs. Jarley went forth with her
head in the air.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The caravan followed at no great distance.
As it went jolting through the streets,
Nell peeped through the window to see in
what kind of place they were.  It was a
pretty large town with an open square, in
the middle of which was the town hall, with
a clock-tower and a weather-cock.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The streets were very clean, very sunny,
very empty, and very dull.  Nothing seemed
to be going on but the clocks, and they had
such drowsy faces, such heavy, lazy hands,
that they surely must have been too slow.
The very dogs were all asleep; and the flies,
drunk with the moist sugar in the grocer's
shop, forgot their wings, and baked to death
in dusty corners of the window.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Rumbling along with a great noise, the
caravan stopped at last at the place of
exhibition.  Nell got down amidst a group
of children, who clearly thought that her
grandfather was one of the wax figures.
The chests were quickly taken out and
unlocked by Mrs. Jarley, who, with George
and another man, was waiting to decorate
the room with the hangings from them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When the festoons were all put up as
tastily as might be, the wax-work figures
were uncovered and set out on a platform
running round the room some two feet from
the floor.  There they stood more or less
unsteadily upon their legs, with their eyes
and nostrils very wide open, and their faces
bearing a look of great surprise.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When Nell had looked at them all with
great delight, Mrs. Jarley ordered the room
to be cleared of all but herself and the child.
Then sitting herself down in an armchair in
the centre, she handed Nell a willow wand,
long used by herself for pointing out the
characters, and was at great pains to teach
her what to do and say.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"That," said Mrs. Jarley in her grandest
tone, as Nell touched a figure at the
beginning of the platform, "is a maid-of-honour
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, who died
from pricking her finger while sewing upon
a Sunday.  See how the blood is trickling
from her finger; also the gold-eyed needle
of the time with which she is at work."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>All this Nell said over twice or thrice,
pointing to the finger and the needle at
the right times, and then passed on to the
next.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When Nell knew all about that and could
say it without a mistake, Mrs. Jarley passed
on to the fat man, and then to the thin man,
the tall man, the short man, the old lady
who died of dancing at a hundred and
thirty-two, the wild boy of the woods, and
many another.  And so well did Nell do her
duty that by the time they had been shut up
together for a couple of hours she knew
quite well the history of the whole show.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Mrs. Jarley was much pleased with her,
and now carried her off to see what was
going on within doors.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The preparations outside had not been
forgotten either.  A nun was telling her
beads on the little portico over the door;
and a brigand, with the blackest possible
head of hair, was at that moment being
made ready to be taken round the town in
a cart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the midst of the plans for drawing
visitors, little Nell was not forgotten.  The
light cart in which the brigand was carried
being gaily dressed with flags and streamers,
the child was placed in a seat beside him,
and rode slowly through the town, giving
away handbills from a basket to the sound
of drum and trumpet.  This was done each
morning for a few days.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The beauty of the child caused a great
stir in the little country place.  Grown-up
folks began to be interested in the bright-eyed
girl, and some score of little boys fell in
love with her, and left nuts and apples for
her at the wax-work door.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was not lost on Mrs. Jarley, who, lest
Nell should become too cheap, soon sent the
brigand out alone again and kept the child
in the room, where she showed the figures
every half-hour.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Although her work was hard, Nell found
the lady of the caravan very kind and
thoughtful for her little helper's comfort.
The child soon began to receive little fees
from the visitors for herself, and as her
grandfather, too, was well treated and useful,
she was very happy and contented.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But she often thought of the old house
and the window at which she used to sit
alone in far-off London; and then she would
think of poor Kit and all his kindness, until
the tears came into her eyes, and she would
weep and smile together.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Often, too, her thoughts turned to her
grandfather, and she would wonder how
much he remembered of their former life.
When they were wandering about she
seldom thought of this, but now she could
not help wondering what would become
of them if he fell sick or her own strength
were to fail her.  The old man was very
patient and willing, and glad to be of use;
but he was a mere child—a poor, thoughtless,
vacant creature.  It made her very sad
to see him thus, and she would often burst
into tears, and going to some secret place,
fall down upon her knees, and pray that he
might be restored.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>One evening when the show was not
open, Nell and her grandfather went
out for a walk.  As soon as they were clear
of the town they took a foot-path which
ran through some pleasant fields, and
wandered on till sunset, when they stopped
to rest.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The sky was dark and lowering.  Large
drops of rain soon began to fall, and before
long the storm clouds came sailing onward,
and spread over all the sky.  Soon was
heard the low rumbling of distant thunder,
and the lightning quivered through the
darkness.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Fearful of taking shelter beneath a tree or
hedge, the old man and the child hurried
along the highroad.  They hoped to find
some house in which to seek a refuge from
the storm.  Drenched by the pelting rain,
and blinded by the lightning, they would
have passed a house without noticing it had
not a man, who was standing at the door,
called out to them to enter.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What were you going past for, eh?" he
added, as he closed the door and led the way
along a passage to a room behind.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We didn't see the house, sir, till we
heard you calling," Nell replied.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No wonder," said the man, "with this
lightning in one's eyes.  By-the-bye you
had better stand by the fire here, and dry
yourselves a bit.  You can call for what you
like if you want anything.  If you don't
want anything, no matter.  Don't be afraid
of that.  This is a public-house, that's all.
The 'Valiant Soldier,' by James Groves, is
pretty well known hereabouts."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The night being warm, there was a large
screen drawn across the room to keep in the
heat of the fire.  From the other side of this
screen came the sound of voices.  Nell and
her grandfather listened to them for a few
moments.  Then the old man said hastily
in a whisper,—</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Nell, they're—they're playing cards.
Don't you hear them?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Look sharp with that candle," said a
voice; "it's as much as I can do to see the
cards as it is.  Game!  Seven-and-sixpence
to me, old Isaac.  Hand over."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do you hear, Nell—do you hear them?"
whispered the old man again, as the money
chinked upon the table.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child looked at the old man with
alarm.  His face was red and eager, his
eyes were strained, his teeth set, his breath
came short and thick, and the hand he
laid upon her arm shook like a leaf.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What money have we, Nell?  Come,
I saw you with money yesterday.  What
money have we?  Give it to me."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No, no; let me keep it, grandfather,"
said the poor child.  "Let us go away from
here.  Do not mind the rain.  Pray let us go."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Give it to me, I say," cried the old man
fiercely.  "Hush, hush! don't cry, Nell.  If
I spoke sharply, dear, I didn't mean it.  It's
for thy good.  I have wronged thee, Nell,
but I will right thee yet; I will, indeed.
Where is the money?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do not take it," said the child.  "Pray
do not take it, dear.  For both our sakes let
me keep it, or let me throw it away; better
let me throw it away than you take it now.
Let us go; do let us go."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Give me the money," returned the old
man; "I must have it.  There—there—there's
my dear Nell.  I'll right thee one
day, child.  I'll right thee, never fear!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She took from her pocket a little purse.
The old man caught it from her hand and
hastily made his way to the other side of the
screen, Nell keeping close behind him.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The landlord had placed a light upon the
table and was drawing the curtain of the
window.  The speakers whom they had
heard were two men, who had a pack of
cards and some silver money between them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The man with the rough voice was a
big fellow of middle age, with large black
whiskers, broad cheeks, a coarse, wide mouth,
and bull neck.  The other man, whom his
companion had called Isaac, was of a more
slender figure—stooping, and high in the
shoulders—with a very evil face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Now, old gentleman," said Isaac, looking
round, "do you know either of us?  This
side of the screen is private, sir."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man replied by shaking the little
purse in his eager hand, and then throwing
it down upon the table, and gathering up
the cards as a miser would clutch at gold.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh!  That, indeed," said Isaac; "if
that's what the gentleman meant, I beg the
gentleman's pardon.  Is this the gentleman's
purse?  A very pretty little purse.  Rather
a light purse," added Isaac, throwing it into
the air and catching it again, "but enough to
amuse a gentleman for half an hour or so."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child, in a perfect agony, drew her
grandfather aside, and begged him, even
then, to come away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Come, and we may be so happy," said
the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We will be happy," replied the old man.
"Let me go, Nell.  I shall but win back
my own; and it's all for thee, my darling."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"God help us!" cried the child.  "Oh,
what hard fortune brought us here?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Hush!" said the old man, laying his
hand upon her mouth.  "We must not
blame fortune, or she shuns us; I have
found that out."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>As he spoke he drew a chair to the table;
and the other three closing round it at the
same time, the game began.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child sat by and watched it with a
troubled mind.  Losses and gains were to
her alike.  She only knew that the cards
were evil things, and that now her quiet,
happy life was at an end.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The storm had raged for full three hours,
and now began to lull; but still the game went
on, and still the poor child was forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The players sat for a long time at their
game, and when it was over Isaac was
the only winner, and Nell's little purse was
quite empty.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do you know what the time is?" said
Mr. Groves, who was smoking with his
friends.  "Past twelve o'clock."—"And a
rainy night," added the stout man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"'The Valiant Soldier,' by James Groves.
Good beds.  Cheap entertainment for man
and beast," said Mr. Groves, quoting from
his sign-board.  "Half-past twelve o'clock."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It's very late," said the uneasy child.
"I wish we had gone before.  What will
they think of us?  It will be two o'clock
by the time we get back.  What would
it cost, sir, if we stopped here?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Two good beds, one-and-sixpence;
supper and beer, one shilling; total, two
shillings and sixpence," replied the landlord.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now, Nell had still a piece of gold sewn
in her dress, and when she thought of the
lateness of the hour she made up her
mind to remain.  She therefore took her
grandfather aside, and telling him that
she had still enough left to pay for their
lodging, said that they ought to stay there
for the night.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If I had but had that money before—if
I had only known of it a few minutes ago!"
muttered the old man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We will stop here, if you please," said
Nell, turning to the landlord.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I think that's prudent," returned
Mr. Groves.  "You shall have your suppers
directly."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Very early the next morning they set out
on their return journey, as Nell wished to
reach home before Mrs. Jarley was up.
The child's heart was very sore when she
thought of all that had happened, but she
could not forget that the old man wished to
win wealth only for her sake.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So she spoke to him very gently, trying to
show him as clearly as she could that she
had no desire to become rich, and least of
all by such evil means.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Let me persuade you—oh, do let me
persuade you," said the child, "to think no
more of gains or losses.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Have we been worse off," she went on,
"since you forgot these cares and we have
been travelling on together?  Have we not
been much better and happier without a
home to shelter us than ever we were in that
unhappy house, when thoughts of winning
wealth were on your mind?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"She speaks the truth," murmured the
old man.  "It must not turn me; but it
is the truth—no doubt it is."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Only remember what we have been since
that bright morning when we turned our
backs upon it for the last time," said Nell;
"only remember what we have been since
we have been free of all those miseries—what
peaceful days and quiet nights we have
had—what pleasant times we have
known—what happiness we have enjoyed.  If we
have been tired or hungry, we have been
soon refreshed, and slept the sounder for it.
Think what beautiful things we have seen,
and how contented we have felt.  And why
was this change?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man stopped her with a motion
of his hand, and bade her talk to him no
more just then, for he was busy.  After a
time he kissed her cheek, without a word,
and walked on, looking far before him, as
if he were trying to collect his thoughts.
Once she saw tears in his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When they reached the wax-work show
they found that Mrs. Jarley was not yet out
of bed.  Nell at once set herself to the work
of preparing the room, and had finished her
task and dressed herself neatly before her
mistress came down to breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>That evening, as she feared, her
grandfather stole away, and did not come back
until the night was far spent.  Worn out as
she was in mind and body, she sat up alone,
counting the minutes until he returned—penniless,
broken-spirited, and wretched.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Get me more money," he said wildly,
as they parted for the night.  "I must have
money, Nell.  It shall be paid thee back
with interest one day, but all the money that
comes into thy hands must be mine—not for
myself, but to use for thee.  Remember,
Nell, to use for thee!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What could poor Nell do but give him
every penny that came into her hands?  If
she told the truth (so thought the child) he
would be treated as a madman; if she did
not supply him with money he would try to
steal it.  Worn out by these thoughts, the
colour forsook her cheek, her eye grew dim,
and her heart was very heavy.  All her old
sorrows had come back upon her; by day
they were ever present to her mind; by
night they haunted her in dreams.</span></p>

<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>Between Nell and her grandfather
there was now a feeling of restraint
and separation.  Every evening, and often in
the daytime too, the old man was absent
alone; and although she well knew where
he went, he never spoke of it, and kept
carefully out of her way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>One evening the child went for a walk
alone.  She sat down beneath a tree, thinking
sorrowfully upon this change, when the
distant church-clock bell struck nine.  Rising
at the sound she set out to return towards
the town.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She was crossing a meadow, when she
came upon an encampment of gipsies, who
had made a fire in one corner at no great
distance from the path, and were sitting or
lying round it.  As she was too poor to have
any fear of them she did not alter her course,
but kept straight on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>But as she passed the spot Nell glanced
towards the fire, and saw to her surprise that
her grandfather made one of the party.  Her
first thought was to call him; her next to
wonder who his new friends could be, and
for what purpose they were there together.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After a few moments she moved nearer to
the group, not across the open fields,
however, but creeping along towards the men by
the foot of the hedge.  In this way she came
at length within a few feet of the fire, and
standing behind a low bush could see and
hear without much danger of being seen
herself.</span></p>

<div class="caption centerleft figure-caption margin">
<span class="italics">After a few moments she moved nearer to the group</span></div>
</div>
<p class="pnext"><span>Near the fire were three men, of whom
her grandfather was one; the others were
the card-players at the public-house on the
night of the storm—Isaac and his rough
friend, whom Nell now heard spoken to as
Jowl.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I go on then," the latter was saying to
Nell's grandfather, "where I left off when
you said you were going home.  If you're
sure that it's time for you to win money,
and find that you haven't enough to try it,
borrow, I say, and when you're able pay it
back again."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Certainly," Isaac List struck in.  "If
this good lady as keeps the wax-works has
money, and </span><em class="italics">does</em><span> keep it in a tin box when
she goes to bed, and </span><em class="italics">doesn't</em><span> lock her door for
fear of fire, it seems an easy thing."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You see, Isaac," said his friend, growing
more eager, and drawing himself closer to
the old man—"you see, Isaac, strangers are
going in and out every hour of the day;
nothing would be more likely than for one
of these strangers to get under the good
lady's bed, or lock himself in the cupboard.
I'd give him his revenge to the last farthing
he brought, whatever the sum was."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah," cried Isaac; "the pleasures of
winning!  The delight of picking up the
money—the bright, shining yellow-boys—and
sweeping 'em into one's pocket!  The—but
you're not going, old gentleman?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I'll do it," said the old man, who had
risen and taken two or three steps away,
and now quickly came back.  "I'll have
it, every penny."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"God be merciful to us!" cried the child
within herself, "and help us in this trying
hour.  What shall I do to save him?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She crept slowly away, keeping in the
shadow of the hedges until she could come
out upon the road at a point where she would
not be seen.  Then she fled homeward as
quickly as she could, and threw herself upon
her bed, almost wild with grief.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The first idea that flashed upon her was
flight.  She would drag the old man from
that place, and rather die of want upon the
roadside than let him stay near such danger.
Then she was torn with a fear that he might
be at that moment robbing Mrs. Jarley;
with a dread of cries in the silence of the
night; with fearful thoughts of what he
might do if he were detected in the act.
She stole to the room where the money was,
opened the door, and looked in.  He was not
there, and Mrs. Jarley was sleeping soundly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She went back to her own room, and
tried to prepare herself for bed.  But how
could she hope to rest?  Half undressed,
she flew to the old man's bedside, took him
by the wrist, and roused him from his sleep.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What's this?" he cried, starting up in
bed, and fixing his eyes upon her white face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have had a dreadful dream," said the
child.  "I have had it once before.  It
is a dream of gray-haired men like you
robbing sleepers of their gold.  Up, up!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man shook in every joint, and
folded his hands like one who prays.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Not to me," said the child, "do not
pray to me—to our Father in heaven to save
us from such deeds.  This dream is too real.
I cannot sleep, I cannot stay here, I cannot
leave you alone under the roof where such
dreams come.  Up!  We must fly."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He looked at her as if she were a spirit—she
might have been one for all the look of
earth she had—and shook more and more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There is no time to lose; I will not lose
one minute," said the child.  "Up, and away
with me!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"To-night?" cried the old man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, to-night," replied the child.  "To-morrow
night will be too late.  The dream
will have come again.  Nothing but flight
can save us.  Up!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The old man rose from his bed, his brow
bedewed with the cold sweat of fear, and,
bending before the child as if she had been
an angel sent to lead him where she would,
made ready to follow her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She took him by the hand and led him on.
As they passed the door of Mrs. Jarley's room
she shivered, and looked up into his face.
What a white face was that, and with what
a look did he meet hers!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>She took him to her own room, and,
still holding him by the hand, gathered
together the little stock of clothes she had,
and hung her basket on her arm.  The old
man took his wallet from her hands, and
strapped it on his shoulders—his staff, too,
she had brought away—and then she led
him forth.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Through the narrow streets their feet
passed quickly.  Up the steep hill, too,
they toiled with rapid steps, and not once
did they look behind.  But as they drew
nearer the walls of the old castle the child
looked back upon the sleeping town, and
as she did so she clasped the hand she held
less firmly, and then, bursting into tears,
fell upon the old man's neck.  Her moment
of weakness past, the child urged him onward
and looked back no more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I have saved him," she thought.  "In all
dangers and distresses I will remember that."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They walked on all that night, and when
the morning broke they laid themselves down
to sleep upon a bank close to a canal.  Nell
was roused by a sound of voices mingling
with her dreams, and when she awoke she
found that a rough-looking man was standing
over them, while two others were looking on
from a long, heavy boat which had come
close to the bank while they were sleeping.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Halloa!" said the man roughly, "what's
the matter here?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We were only asleep, sir," said Nell.
"We have been walking all night."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A pair of queer travellers to be walking
all night," said the man.  "One of you is
too old for that sort of work, and the other
too young.  Where are you going?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell pointed at hazard towards the west,
upon which the man asked if she meant
a certain town which he named.  Nell, to
avoid more questions, said, "Yes, that was
the place."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Where have you come from?" was the
next question; and Nell named the village
in which their friend the schoolmaster dwelt,
as being less likely to be known to the men.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I thought somebody had been ill-using
you, might be," said the man.  "That's all.
Good-day."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Good-day," Nell said, and looked after
him as he mounted one of the horses which
were used to draw the boat.  It had not
gone very far when it stopped again, and she
saw the men waving to her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Did you call me?" said Nell, running
up to them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You may go with us if you like," replied
one of those in the boat.  "We're going to
the same place."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Thinking that if they went with the men
all traces of them would be lost, Nell thanked
him, and in another moment she and her
grandfather were on board, gliding smoothly
down the canal.  After a long journey the
boat floated up to the wharf of a great town,
where tall chimneys sent forth a dense, black
vapour, and the clang of hammers mingled
with the roar of busy streets and noisy crowds.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was raining heavily.  The child and her
grandfather passed through a dirty lane into
a crowded street, where they stood for a few
moments.  The throng of people hurried by,
while the two poor strangers, stunned by the
bustle and noise, looked sadly on.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Evening came on; they were still wandering
up and down.  The lights in the streets
and shops made them feel yet more lonely.
Shivering with the cold and damp, and sick
at heart, the child found it very hard to
creep along at all.</span></p>

earn our bread in very humble work."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ah! poor, houseless, motherless child,"
cried the old man, clasping his hands, and
gazing as if for the first time upon her white
face, her torn dress, and swollen feet; "has
all my care brought her to this at last?
Was I a happy man once, and have I lost
happiness and all I had for this?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"If we were in the country now," said
the child, as cheerfully as she could, "we
should find some good old tree, stretching
out his green arms as if he loved us, and
nodding as if he would have us fall asleep;
thinking of him while he watched.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Please God," she went on, "we shall
be there soon—to-morrow, or the next day
at the farthest; and in the meantime let us
think, dear, that it was a good thing we
came here; for we are lost in the crowd
and hurry of this place, and if any cruel
people should pursue us, they could surely
never trace us farther.  There's comfort in
that.  And here's a deep old doorway—very
dark, but quite dry, and warm too, for the
wind does not blow in here.  What's that?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Uttering a half shriek, she fell back before
a black figure which came out of the door-way
where they were about to take refuge,
and stood still, looking at them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Speak again," it said; "do I know that voice?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"No," replied the child; "we are strangers,
and having no money for a night's lodging,
we were going to rest here."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was a lamp at no great distance—the
only one in the place, which was a kind of
square yard, but sufficient to show how poor
and mean it was.  To this the man beckoned
them, and soon they stood looking at each
other in the light of its rays.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The stranger was poorly clad and very dirty.
His voice was harsh, but though his face was
half hidden with long, dark hair, it was
neither unkind nor bad.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How came you to think of resting here?"
he said.  "Or how," he added, looking
closely at the child, "do you come to want
a place of rest at this time of night?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Our misfortunes," the old man said, "are
the cause."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Do you know," said the man, looking
still more closely at Nell, "how wet she is,
and that the damp streets are not a place for
her?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I know it well, God help me," he replied.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"What can I do?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The man looked at Nell again, and gently
touched her dress, from which the rain
was running off in little streams.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I can give you warmth," he said, after
a pause, "nothing else.  Such lodging as I
have is in that house"—pointing to the
doorway from which he had come—"but
she is safer and better there than here.  The
fire is in a rough place, but you can pass the
night beside it safely, if you'll trust yourselves
to me.  You see that red light yonder?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They raised their eyes, and saw in the
dark sky the dull light of some distant fire.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It's not far," said the man.  "Shall I
take you there?  You were going to sleep
upon cold bricks; I can give you a bed
of warm ashes, nothing better."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Without waiting for any reply he took Nell
in his arms, and bade the old man follow.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This is the place," he said, after a long
walk, pausing at a door to put Nell down
and take her hand.  "Don't be afraid;
there's nobody here will harm you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>With some fear and alarm they entered a
large and lofty building, echoing to the roof
with the beating of hammers and roar of
furnaces, mingled with the hissing of red-hot
metal plunged in water.  In this gloomy
place, moving like demons among the flame
and smoke, a number of men worked like
giants.  Others, lying upon heaps of coals or
ashes, slept or rested from their toil.  Others
again, opening the white-hot furnace doors,
cast fuel on the flames, which came rushing
forth to meet it, and licked it up like oil.
Others drew forth, upon the ground, great
sheets of glowing, red-hot steel.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Through this strange place their new
friend led them to where one furnace burnt
by night and day.  The man who had been
watching this fire, and whose task was ended
for the present, gladly withdrew, and left
them with their friend.  He at once spread
Nell's little cloak upon a heap of ashes, and
showing her where she could hang her outer
clothes to dry, signed to her and the old man
to lie down and sleep.  Then he took his
station on a ragged mat before the furnace
door, and resting his chin upon his hands,
watched the flame as it shone through the
iron chinks, and the white ashes as they fell
into their bright, hot grave below.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The warmth of her bed, hard and humble
as it was, soon caused the noise of the place
to fall with a gentler sound upon the child's
tired ears, and was not long in lulling her to
sleep.  The old man was stretched beside
her, and with her hand upon his neck she
lay and dreamed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was yet night when she awoke, nor did
she know for how long or how short a time
she had slept.  But she found herself
protected, both from any cold air that might
find its way into the building and from the
heat, by some of the workmen's clothes; and
glancing at their friend, saw that he still sat
looking towards the fire, and keeping so
very quiet that he did not even seem to
breathe.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell lay in the state between sleeping and
waking, looking so long at him that at length
she almost feared he had died as he sat
there; and softly rising and drawing close
to him, she whispered in his ear.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He moved at once, and looked into her face.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I feared you were ill," she said.  "The
other men are all moving, and you are so
very quiet."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"They leave me to myself," he replied.
"They know my way.  They laugh at me,
but don't harm me in it.  See yonder,
there—that's my friend."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"The fire?" said the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It has been alive for as long as I have,"
the man made answer.  "We talk and think
together all night long."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The child glanced quickly at him in her
surprise, but he had turned his eyes away
and was musing as before.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It's like a book to me," he said—"the
only book I ever learned to read; and many
an old story it tells me.  It's music; for I
should know its voice among a thousand, and
there are other voices in its roar.  It has
its pictures too.  You don't know how
many strange faces and different scenes I
trace in the red-hot coals.  But you should
be sleeping now.  Lie down again, poor
child, lie down again!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>With that, he led her to her rude couch,
and covering her with the clothes once more,
returned to his seat.  The child watched
him for a little time, but soon gave way to
the drowsiness that came upon her, and in
the dark, strange place and on the heap of
ashes slept as peacefully as if the room had
been a palace and her resting-place a bed of
down.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When she woke again, broad day was
shining through the openings in the walls.
The noise was still going on, and the fires
were burning fiercely as before; for few
changes of night and day brought rest or
quiet there.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Her friend shared his breakfast—coffee,
and some coarse bread—with the child and
her grandfather, and asked where they were
going.  She told him that they sought
some distant country place, and asked what
road they would do best to take.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I know little of the country," he said,
shaking his head; "but there are such
places yonder."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And far from here?" said Nell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ay, surely.  How could they be near
us, and be green and fresh?  The road lies,
too, through miles and miles all lighted up
by fires like ours—a strange, black road, and
one that would frighten you by night."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We are here, and must go on," said the
child boldly.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Rough people—paths never made for
little feet like yours—a dismal way—is there
no turning back, my child?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There is none," cried Nell, pressing
forward.  "If you can direct us, do.  If not,
pray do not seek to stop us.  Indeed, you
do not know the danger that we shun, and
how right and true we are in flying from
it, or you would not try to stop us; I am
sure you would not."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"God forbid, if it is so!" said the man,
glancing from the child to her grandfather,
who hung his head and bent his eyes upon
the ground.  "I'll show you from the door,
the best I can.  I wish I could do more."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He showed them, then, by which road
they must leave the town, and what course
they should take when they had gained it.
Then the child, with heartfelt thanks, tore
herself away, and stayed to hear no more.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In all their wanderings they had never
longed so much as now for the pure air of
the open country; no, not even on that
morning when, deserting their old home,
they gave themselves up to the mercies of
a strange world.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Two days and nights!" thought the
child.  "He said two days and nights we
should have to spend among such scenes as
these.  Oh, if we live to reach the country
once again, if we get clear of these dreadful
places, though it is only to lie down and
die, with what a grateful heart I shall thank
God for so much mercy!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We shall be very slow to-day, dear," she
said as they went wearily through the streets;
"my feet are so sore, and I have pains in
all my limbs from the wet of yesterday.
I saw that our friend looked at us and
thought of that when he said how long
we should be upon the road."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>That night she lay down with nothing
between her and the sky, and, with no fear
for herself, for she was past it now, put up
a prayer for the poor old man.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>A penny loaf was all they had eaten that
day.  It was very little, but even hunger
was forgotten in the peaceful feeling that
crept over Nell.  She lay down very gently,
and with a quiet smile upon her face, fell
into a light slumber.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The next morning came, and with it
came to Nell a dull feeling that she was
very ill.  She had no wish to eat.  Her
grandfather ate greedily, which she was
glad to see.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Their way lay through the same scenes
as on the previous day.  There was the same
thick air, the same blighted ground, the
same misery and poverty.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Evening was drawing on, but had not
closed in, when they came to another busy
town.  After humbly asking for help at
some few doors, and having been refused,
they agreed to make their way out of the
place as speedily as they could.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They were dragging themselves along
through the last street, and the child now felt
that the time was close at hand when she
could bear no more.  There appeared
before them at this moment, going in the
same direction as themselves, a traveller on
foot, who, with a bag on his back, leaned
upon a stout stick as he walked and read
from a book which he held in his other
hand.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>It was not an easy matter to come up with
him and ask his aid, for he walked fast, and
was some little distance before them.  But
soon he stopped to look more closely at his
book.  Then the child shot on before her
grandfather, and, going close to the stranger,
began in a few faint words to beg his help.
He turned his head.  The child clapped her
hands together, gave a wild shriek, and fell
senseless at his feet.</span></p>

<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">A FRIEND IN NEED.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>It was the poor schoolmaster—no other
than the poor schoolmaster.  Scarcely
less surprised by the sight of the child than
she herself had been at the sight of him, he
stood for a moment without even trying to
raise her from the ground.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Then he threw down his stick and book,
and dropping on one knee beside her, tried
to restore her, while her grandfather, standing
idly by, wrung his hands and begged her to
speak to him, were it only a single word.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"She is quite worn out," said the schoolmaster,
glancing upward into his face.
"You have tried her too far, friend."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"She is dying of want," rejoined the old
man, "I never thought how weak and ill
she was till now."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Without another word the schoolmaster
took the child in his arms, and bidding the
old man gather up her little basket and
follow him, bore her away at his utmost
speed.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>There was a small inn within sight,
towards which he hurried with his burden,
and rushing into the kitchen, placed it on a
chair before the fire.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The landlady soon came running in,
followed by her servant girl, carrying
vinegar, hartshorn, and smelling-salts; and
under their treatment the child came to
herself after a while, and was able to thank
them in a faint voice.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Without suffering her to speak another
word, the women carried her off to bed; and
having covered her up warm, bathed her
cold feet, and wrapped them in flannel, they
sent for the doctor.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He came with all speed, and taking his
seat by the bedside of poor Nell, drew out
his watch and felt her pulse.  Next he
looked at her tongue, then he felt her pulse
again.  At last he said very gravely, "Put
her feet in hot water, and wrap them up in
flannel.  I should likewise," he went on,
"give her something light for supper—say
the wing of a roasted fowl."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Why, goodness gracious me, sir, it's
cooking at the kitchen fire this instant!"
cried the landlady.  And so, indeed, it was;
for the schoolmaster had ordered it to be put
down, and it was getting on so well that the
doctor might have smelt it if he had
tried—perhaps he did.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While her supper was preparing, the child
fell into a deep sleep, from which they were
forced to rouse her when it was ready.  As
she was greatly troubled at the thought of
being parted from her grandfather, the old
man took his supper with her.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Finding her still very restless about him,
they made him up a bed in an inner room.
The key of this chamber was on that side
of the door which was in Nell's room; the
poor child turned it on him when the landlady
had gone, and crept to bed again with a
thankful heart.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>In the morning the child was better, but
she was very weak, and would need at least
a day's rest and careful nursing before she
could go on her journey.  The schoolmaster
at once said that he had a day to spare—two
days for that matter—and could well afford
to wait.  As the patient was to sit up in the
evening, he said he would visit her in her
room at a certain hour, and going out with
his book, he did not return until that hour
arrived.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell could not help weeping when they
were left alone; whereat, and at the sight of
her pale face and wasted figure, the simple
schoolmaster shed a few tears himself.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"It makes me unhappy, even in the midst
of all this kindness," said the child, "to
think that we should be a burden upon you.
How can I ever thank you?  If I had not
met you so far from home I must have
died, and he would have been left alone."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We'll not talk about dying," said the
schoolmaster; "and as to burdens, I have
made my fortune since you slept at my
cottage."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed!" cried the child joyfully.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh yes," returned her friend.  "I have
been chosen as clerk and schoolmaster to a
village a long way from here, and a long way
from the old one, as you may suppose, at
five-and-thirty pounds a year.  Five-and-thirty
pounds!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am very glad," said the child—"so
very, very glad."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am on my way there now," the
schoolmaster went on.  "They gave me the
stage-coach hire—outside stage-coach hire
all the way.  Bless you, they grudge me
nothing.  But as I have plenty of time,
I made up my mind to walk.  How glad I
am to think I did so!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"How glad should we be!" said the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes," said the schoolmaster,
"certainly—that's very true.  But you—where
are you going, where are you coming from,
what have you been doing since you left me,
what had you been doing before?  Now,
tell me—do tell me.  I know very little of
the world, but I have a reason for loving
you.  I have felt since the time you visited
me in my home as if my love for the boy
who died had been given to you."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The kindness of the honest man gave the
child a great trust in him.  She told him
all—that they had no friends or relations;
that she had fled with the old man to save
him from misery; that she was flying now
to save him from himself; and that she
sought a home where he would not be
tempted again.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>For some time the schoolmaster sat deep
in thought; then he said that Nell and
her grandfather should go with him to the
village whither he was bound; and that he
would try to find them some work by which
they could make a living.  "We shall be
sure to get on," said the schoolmaster; "the
cause is too good a one to fail."</span></p>
<p class="pnext" id="id1"><span>They soon found that a stage-wagon
would stop at the inn the next night to
change horses.  When the wagon came Nell
was placed inside, and in due time it rolled
away, the two men walking on beside the
driver, and the landlady and all the good
folks of the inn shouting out their good
wishes and farewells.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>What a soothing, drowsy way of travelling,
to lie inside that slowly moving mountain,
listening to the tinkling of the horses' bells,
the smacking of the carter's whip, the smooth
rolling of the great broad wheels, the rattle of
the harness, the cheery good-nights of passing
travellers, all falling lightly upon the ear!</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Now and again Nell would walk for a
mile or two while her grandfather rode
inside, and sometimes even the schoolmaster
would take her place and lie down to rest.
So they went on very happily until they
came to a large town, where the wagon
stopped, and they spent the night.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When they had passed through this town
they came into the open country, and after
a long ride began to draw near the
schoolmaster's new home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"See—here's the church!" cried the
delighted schoolmaster in a low voice; "and
that old building close beside it is the
school-house, I'm sure.  Five-and-thirty pounds a
year in this lovely place!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They admired everything—the old gray
porch, the fine old windows, the gravestones
in the green churchyard, the old tower, the
very weather-cock, the brown thatched roofs
of cottage barns peeping from among the
trees, the stream that ran by the distant
water-mill, the blue mountains far away.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I must leave you somewhere for a few
minutes," said the schoolmaster at length.
"I have a letter to present, you know.
Where shall I take you?  To the little inn
yonder?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Let us wait here," said Nell.  "The
gate is open.  We will sit in the church
porch till you come back."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A good place, too," said the schoolmaster,
leading the way towards it, and
placing his bag on the stone seat.  "Be sure
that I will come back with good news, and
will not be long gone."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>So the happy schoolmaster put on a pair
of new gloves which he had carried in a little
parcel in his pocket all the way, and hurried
off, full of pleasant excitement.</span></p>

<p class="center pnext"><span class="bold large">PEACE AFTER STORM.</span></p>
<div class="vspace" style="height: 2em">
</div>
<p class="pfirst"><span>After a long time the schoolmaster
appeared at the wicket-gate of the
churchyard, and hurried towards them,
jingling in his hand, as he came along, a
bundle of rusty keys.  He was quite
breathless with pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You see those two old houses?" he said
at last.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, surely," replied Nell.  "I have
been looking at them nearly all the time you
have been away."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"And you would have looked at them
still more if you could have guessed what I
have to tell you," said her friend.  "One of
those houses is mine."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Without saying any more, or giving the
child time to reply, the schoolmaster took
her hand, and his honest face shining with
pleasure, led her to the place of which he
spoke.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They stopped before its low, arched door.
After trying several of the keys in vain, the
schoolmaster found one to fit the huge lock,
which turned back creaking, and they stepped
within.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The room which they entered was large
and lofty, with a finely decorated roof.  "It
is a very beautiful place!" said the child in
a low voice.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A peaceful place to live in; don't you
think so?" said her friend.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Oh yes!" said the child, clasping her
hands earnestly; "a quiet, happy place."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"A place to live and gather health of
mind and body in," said the schoolmaster;
"and this old house is yours."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ours!" cried the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Ay," said the schoolmaster gaily, "for
many a merry year to come, I hope.  I shall
be a close neighbour—only next door; but
this house is yours."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Having now told his great news, the
schoolmaster sat down, and drawing Nell to
his side, told her how he had learned that
that house had been occupied for a very long
time by an old person, who kept the keys of
the church, opened and closed it for the
services, and showed it to strangers; how she
had died not many weeks ago, and nobody
had yet been found to fill the office; how,
learning all this, he had been bold enough to
mention his friends to the clergyman.  In a
word, the result was that Nell and her
grandfather were to go before the last-named
gentleman next day, and if they pleased him
they were to be given the charge of the
church.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"There's a small allowance of money,"
said the schoolmaster.  "It is not much, but
still enough to live upon.  By clubbing our
funds together we shall do well; no fear of
that."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Heaven bless you!" sobbed the child.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Amen, my dear," returned her friend
cheerfully; "and all of us, as it will, and
has, in leading us through sorrow and trouble
to this peaceful life.  But we must look at
my house now.  Come!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They went to the other door, tried the
rusty keys as before, and at length found the
right one.  Like the first house, it held such
pieces of furniture as were needful, and had
its stack of firewood.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>To make these houses as tidy and comfortable
as they could was now their pleasant
care.  In a short time each had its cheerful
fire glowing and crackling on the hearth.
Nell, busily plying her needle, mended the
torn window-hangings, drew together the
rents which time had worn in the scraps of
carpet, and made them whole and decent.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The schoolmaster swept and smoothed the
ground before the door, trimmed the long
grass, trained the ivy and creeping plants,
and gave to the outer walls a cheery air of
home.  The old man, sometimes by his side
and sometimes with the child, lent his aid to
both, went here and there on little, useful
services, and was happy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Neighbours, too, as they came from work,
offered their help or sent their children with
such small presents or loans as the strangers
needed most.  It was a busy day, and night
came on and found them wondering that
there was yet so much to do, and that it
should be dark so soon.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>They took their supper together in the
house which may henceforth be called the
child's; and when they had finished their
meal, drew round the fire, and almost in
whispers—their hearts were too quiet and
glad for loud talking—talked over their
future plans.  Before they separated the
schoolmaster read some prayers aloud, and
then they parted for the night.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Next day they all worked gaily in arranging
their houses until noon, and then went
to visit the clergyman.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>He received them very kindly, and at
once showed an interest in Nell, asking her
name and age, her birthplace, why she left
her home, and so forth.  The schoolmaster
had already told her story.  They had no
other friends or home to leave, he said, and
had come to share his life.  He loved the
child as though she were his own.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Well, well," said the clergyman, "let
it be as you wish.  She is very young."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Old in troubles and trials, sir," replied
the schoolmaster.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"God help her.  Let her rest and forget
them," said the old gentleman, laying his
hand upon her head, and smiling at her.
"Your request is granted, friend."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After more kind words they went to the
child's house, where they were talking over
their happy fortune when another friend
appeared.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This was a little old gentleman who had
lived in the parsonage house ever since the
death of the clergyman's wife, which had
happened fifteen years before.  He had been his
college friend and always his close companion.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The little old gentleman was the friend
of every one in the place.  None of the
simple villagers had cared to ask his name,
or, when they knew it, to store it in their
memory, and he was known simply as the
Bachelor.  The name pleased him, or suited
him as well as any other, and the Bachelor
he had ever since remained.  And the
Bachelor it was, it may be added, who with
his own hands had laid in the stock of fuel
which the wanderers had found in their
new home.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Bachelor, then, lifted the latch,
showed his little, round, mild face for a
moment at the door, and stepped into the
room like one who was no stranger to it.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You are Mr. Marton, the new schoolmaster?"
he said, greeting Nell's kind friend.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am, sir."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"I am glad to see you.  I should have
come to greet you yesterday, but I rode across
the country to carry a message from a sick
mother to her daughter in service some
miles off, and have but just now returned.
This is our young church-keeper?  You
are not the less welcome, friend, for her
sake or for this old man's."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"She has been ill, sir, very lately," said
the schoolmaster.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, yes; I know she has," he said.
"There have been suffering and heartache
here."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Indeed there have, sir."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The little old gentleman glanced at the
grandfather, and back again at the child,
whose hand he took tenderly in his and held.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"You will be happier here," he said,
"We will try, at least, to make you so.
You have made great changes here already.
Are they the work of your hands?"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Yes, sir," said Nell.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"We will make some others—not better
in themselves, but with better means,
perhaps," said the Bachelor.  "Let us see
now, let us see."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Nell went with him into the other little
rooms, and over both the houses, in which
he found various small comforts wanting,
which he said he would supply, and then
went away.  After some five or ten minutes
he came back laden with old shelves, rugs,
and blankets, and followed by a boy bearing
another load.  These being cast on the
floor in a heap, Nell and her new friend
spent a happy time in sorting and arranging
them.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>When nothing more was left to be done,
the Bachelor told the boy to run off and
bring all his schoolmates before their new
master.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"As good a set of fellows, Marton, as
you'd wish to see," he said, turning to the
schoolmaster when the boy was gone; "but
I don't let 'em know I think so.  That
wouldn't do at all."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The boy soon returned at the head of
a long row of others, great and small, who
stood shyly before the little group of which
the Bachelor was the centre.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This first boy, schoolmaster," said the
little gentleman, "is John Owen; a lad of
good parts, sir, and frank, honest temper,
but too thoughtless, too playful, too
light-headed by far.  That boy, my good sir,
would break his neck with pleasure; and
between ourselves, when you come to see
him at hare-and-hounds, taking the fence
and ditch by the finger-post, and sliding
down the face of the little quarry, you'll
never forget it.  It's beautiful!"</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>John Owen having been thus rebuked,
the Bachelor singled out another boy.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"Now, look at that lad, sir," said the
Bachelor.  "You see that fellow?  Richard
Evans his name is, sir.  An amazing boy
to learn, blessed with a good memory; and
moreover, with a good voice and ear for
psalm-singing, at which he is the best
among us.  Yet, sir, that boy will come
to a bad end; he'll never die in his bed;
he's always falling asleep in sermon time—and
to tell you the truth, Mr. Marton, I
always did the same at his age, and feel
quite certain that I couldn't help it."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>This hopeful pupil having been thus
described, the Bachelor turned to another.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"But if," said he, "we come to a boy that
should be a warning to all his fellows, here's
the one, and I hope you won't spare him.
This is the lad, sir—this one with the blue
eyes and light hair.  This is a swimmer,
sir—this fellow—a diver.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>"This is a boy, sir," he went on, "who
had a fancy for plunging into eighteen feet
of water with his clothes on, and bringing up
a blind man's dog that was being drowned
by the weight of its chain and collar, while
its master stood wringing his hands upon
the bank.  I sent the boy two guineas, sir,"
added the Bachelor in a whisper, "directly
I heard of it; but never mention it, for he
hasn't the least idea that it came from me."</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Bachelor now turned to another boy,
and from him to another, and so on through
the whole line.  Feeling quite sure in the
end that he had made them miserable by
his severity, he sent them away with a small
present and a severe warning to walk quietly
home without any leaping, scufflings, or
turnings out of the way.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>After a few moments the schoolmaster
parted from him with a light heart and
joyous spirits, and thought himself one of
the happiest men on earth.  The windows
of the two old houses were ruddy again that
night with the warm light of the cheerful
fires that burnt within; and the Bachelor
and his old friend, the clergyman, pausing
to look upon them as they returned from
their evening walk, spoke softly together of
the beautiful child who had at last found a
haven of rest in the village they both loved
so well.</span></p>

assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain

<p class="pfirst"><span>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit </span><a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst"><span>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</span></p>
<p class="pnext"><span>Corrected </span><em class="italics">editions</em><span> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is
renamed. </span><em class="italics">Versions</em><span> based on separate sources are treated as new
eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</span></p>
